Phase 7 is **very rare air** 🚀
This is where you move beyond *Staff / Principal Engineer* into **org-level, industry-level, or founder-level impact**.

I’ll keep the **same structured TODO checklist style**, but Phase 7 focuses on **vision, leverage, and irreversible decisions**.

## 🔥 Hard Truth About Phase 7

This phase is:
❌ Not about promotions
❌ Not about tools
❌ Not about coding every day

It *is* about:
✅ Judgment
✅ Vision
✅ Trust
✅ Long-term impact

## 🧭 Final Perspective

Most engineers never reach Phase 7 because:

* It requires **letting go of control**
* It requires **thinking in decades**
* It requires **owning consequences**

If you reach here, you don’t “level up” anymore —
**you shape the field** 🌍

---

If you want next, I can:

* Map **Phases 0–7 to FAANG levels**
* Design a **CTO readiness checklist**
* Create a **founder technical playbook**
* Show **how to transition from IC → exec**
* Help choose **Distinguished vs CTO path**

Just say the word.
